	<h3>Wine Tasting:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="/images/sponsors/Carvalho_logo.jpg" style="" /><strong>Carvalho Family Winery</strong> &ndash;
			Starting in the villages and vineyards of Portugal, winemaking has been a Carvalho family tradition. 
			Today, Carvalho Family Winery continues that tradition as a premium winery, dedicated to the production 
			of small-lot, hand-crafted California wines using grapes from the Clarksburg appellation and other 
			high-quality vineyards throughout California. We take an old world approach to winemaking paired with 
			the best viticulture and enological tools available in the world today.</li>

			<li><img src="/images/sponsors/Cooper_Vineyards_logo.jpg" style="" /><strong>Cooper Vineyard</strong> &ndash;
			We believe that winemaking begins in the vineyard and at Cooper Vineyards, farming in the 
			Shenandoah Valley of Amador County spans five generations.  
			Cooper history is embedded in the soil our vines thrive in. 
			Thanks tothe winemaking talent of Michael Roser, we offer an exciting portfolio of seventeen wines.</li>

			<li><img src="/images/sponsors/PRP_International.jpg" style="" /><strong>PRP Wine International</strong> &ndash;
			The mission of PRP Wine International is to provide consistently top quality products to our clients.
			To do this, we strive for variety and innovation in everything we do, from the products we 
			develop to the way they are packaged and presented.  Our product is marketed through in-home 
			tastings and special events.  Our Wine Consultants educate and inform about fine wines and how to match 
			them with delicious cuisine.</li>

			<li><img src="/images/sponsors/DGV_logo.jpg" style="" /><strong>David Girard Vineyards</strong> &ndash;
			David Girard Vineyards is an 86 acre estate with 35 acres of planted vineyard.  
			Just over a mile from the banks of the American River, DGV is located in the golden foothills of Sierras 
			at an elevation of 1400 feet. The unique combination of climate, soil, and topography found in the El Dorado 
			appellation is similar to the Rho&#770;ne Valley, so DGV planted classic varietals including: Roussanne, Marsanne, 
			Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Rolle (Vermentino), Syrah, Mourve&#768;dre, Grenache, and Counoise.  They also have about 
			10 acres planted to Merlot, Malbec, and Touriga Na&ccedil;ional. At David Girard Vineyards, they make a number of wines 
			from our Estate fruit, as well as an array of blends of both white and red wines. With a focus on meticulous 
			farming practices and an approach to winemaking that combines timeless traditions with innovative techniques, 
			DGV wines aspire to balance of flavor, beautiful aromatics and expression of their unique place in the California 
			landscape.</li>

			<li><img src="/images/sponsors/OlRepublicLogo.png" style="" /><strong>ol' Republic Brewery</strong> &ndash;
			Winner of several California State Fair medals, ol' Republic Brewery opened its doors in February 2012 
			in the historic mining town of Nevada City. Brewers Jim Harte and Simon Olney have reinvented a variety 
			of old-world beer styles, from classic European lagers and robust ales from the British Isles to American 
			beer styles dating back to the mid-19th century. Their handcrafted lagers include Dortmunder Export, 
			a Helles and their version of a California Common. Ales include an English-style IPA, a Celtic Red and 
			the blackest Export Stout you will ever encounter.
